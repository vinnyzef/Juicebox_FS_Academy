Nothing less than a Back-End-Only project. We are going to make a "Simple" Tumblr clone. I use quotes around simple because it will be anything but simple for us to implement.

We will be designing a back-end which has both a Database layer as well as (later) a web server with a custom API, and testing it by curling against the endpoints we create.

This project is probably the hardest, since it involves two totally new technologies, so it is written more as a tutorial, with fewer open ends.

Additionally, each day has starting code from the day before. Use this knowledge carefully, and try not to rely on the starting code too much, since it has the potential to jump you ahead of your current understanding of the materials.

Also, there's not a great preview for this part of the project, so a screenshot is being omitted at this time.
